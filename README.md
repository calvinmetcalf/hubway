realtime hubway tracker all client side. 

Inspired by http://www.hubwaytracker.com/ (well technically http://www.cabitracker.com/ I didn't notice the boston version until later) but done totally on the client side.

http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/ is used to get around the same origin policy and https://developers.google.com/chart/image/ is used for the graphs. Should work in modern desktop browsers and IE 8.  We shall see about mobile browsers, don't hold your breath for earlier IE versions.
